# Art-Science Fusion Engine

## Overview

The **Art-Science Fusion Engine** is an innovative AI-powered platform that transforms scientific data into dynamic, interactive visualizations. Designed for educational use, it allows students to explore complex scientific concepts—like physics equations, biological structures, and astronomical data—through engaging, visually appealing art forms. With VR integration, students can interact with these visualizations collaboratively, making abstract scientific principles more tangible and accessible.

## Key Features

- **AI-Driven Visualizations of Scientific Data**: Converts data from fields like physics, biology, and astronomy into stunning, interactive visualizations.
- **Generative Art Models**: Uses neural networks to create artful representations of scientific data, combining style transfer and generative models.
- **Collaborative VR Experience**: Allows students to work together in a VR environment, creating and modifying scientific visualizations in real-time.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/art-science-fusion-engine.git
   cd art-science-fusion-engine
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Install required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up VR Environment**

   - Open the Unity project in `src/vr_interface/collaborative_vr_space.unity`.
   - Configure VR settings for your specific hardware (e.g., Oculus Rift, HTC Vive).
   - Run the VR simulation to start exploring the collaborative space.

## Usage

### 1. Generating Visualizations

   You can generate data-driven visualizations by setting parameters in the provided data processing scripts.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   from src.data_processing.physics_data_visualizer import PhysicsDataVisualizer

   # Initialize visualizer and generate a wave pattern
   visualizer = PhysicsDataVisualizer("wave")
   visualizer.generate_wave_pattern(frequency=2, amplitude=1)
   ```

### 2. Applying Style Transfer

   Use the AI-driven style transfer model to apply an artistic style to your scientific visualizations, enhancing their visual appeal.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   from src.ai_visualization.style_transfer import StyleTransferModel

   # Initialize the style transfer model with a chosen style image
   model = StyleTransferModel("path/to/style_image.jpg")
   model.apply_style("path/to/content_image.jpg")
   ```

### 3. Collaborative VR Interface

   In VR, students can interact with scientific visualizations, adjust parameters (e.g., frequency, amplitude), and observe changes in real-time. The collaborative space enables multiple students to join, share, and discuss their creations in a 3D environment.

   **Instructions**:
   - Open the Unity project in `src/vr_interface`.
   - Launch the VR simulation, and enter the collaborative VR space.
   - Use VR controllers to interact with the visualizations and adjust settings interactively.
